 *
 * **Authorship - local or remote.** Which client produced the message. It
 * decides the edge, the fill, and which side of the column the run hugs, and it
 * is derived here from `viewerId` rather than demanded of the caller, because
 * "mine" is not a property of a message: the same row is mine in one window and
 * theirs in another.
 *
 * **Acknowledgement - optimistic or confirmed.** Whether the server has it.
 * This is about delivery, not authorship, and it exists on the local side only.
 *
 * The interaction is the part worth stating: **a remote run never shows a
 * tick, and a local run always does.** Not "does not by default" - never.
 * `conversationRuns` strips a status off a remote message rather than declining
 * to draw one, because a delivery mark is a claim about our outbox and there is
 * nothing behind that claim for a message someone else sent; a transport that
 * stamps every row it syncs is an ordinary thing, and the resulting tick would
 * be a lie the reader has no way to detect. The mirror of that rule fills a
 * status in on a local message that arrived without one, because a local
 * message reporting nothing is indistinguishable from one that never sent.
 *
 * An unacknowledged send reads as *in flight*, not as broken: the run keeps its
 * colour and steps back by a single alpha, and the delivery atom's clock glyph
 * carries the rest. No spinners. Every message is optimistic for a moment, and
 * a transcript that spun for each of them would be a loading screen with words
 * in it. A failed send does the opposite and stays at full strength with the
 * danger border, because it is the one row asking to be acted on.
 *
 * Scrolling is deliberately thin. It follows the live end while the reader is
 * already there and does nothing at all once they have scrolled up. There is no
 * anchoring, no offset preservation across prepends, no jump-to-latest button -
 * the heavy machinery belongs to a virtualised list, and the honest version of
 * "stick to bottom" is one comparison, in @glacier/logic, shared with native.
